# Dog Cat Classification using transfer learning

## What is transfer learning?
transfer learning is a deep learning technique where we train a pre-trained model. This model is trained for one task and can be re-trained for a similar task with a smaller data set.

It gives higher accuracy compared to training models from scratch.
